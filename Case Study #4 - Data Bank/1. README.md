# Introduction
There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world…so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

# Recommendation

1. Continuously oberve and analyze the data allocation trends from time to time to idenitify any patterns or significant changes. This is crucial in understanding the evolving needs of data storage and adjustments needed to accomodate the demands in the future.
2. More rigourous and detailed analysis is needed to futher understand the data of negative values behind, which could be detrimental to bank's overall financial health in the long run. Hence, more data such as surveys is needed to better understand customer behaviour during those months and potentially identify any trends or anomalies behind these high negatives balance of bank's customers.
3. More targeted promotional campaigns and acitivities are needed for customers with low account balance to deposit fresh funds into their bank account and spend with it.
4. With that being said, incentives such as promotional rates and high reward cashback could also attract more potential new customers to open a accounts for spending.
5. Regularly adjust resource allocation strategies and developing new business strategies aligning with technological advancements to optimize data storage needs while reducing bank's operating cost.
