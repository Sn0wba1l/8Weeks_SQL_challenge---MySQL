## B. Customer Transactions

## Case Study Questions
1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?
5. What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?

### 1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

```sql
SELECT txn_type,COUNT(txn_amount) AS no_transaction, SUM(txn_amount) AS total_amount
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY txn_type;
```
#### Result set:
| txn_type     | no_transaction | total_amount   |
| ------------ | -------------  | -------------  |
| deposit      | 2671           | 1359168        |
| withdrawal   | 1580           | 793003         |
| purchase     | 1617           | 806537         |

### 2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
```sql
SELECT round(count(customer_id)/
               (SELECT count(DISTINCT customer_id)
                FROM customer_transactions)) AS average_deposit_count,
       concat('$', round(avg(txn_amount), 2)) AS average_deposit_amount
FROM customer_transactions
WHERE txn_type = "deposit";
```
#### Result set:
| average_deposit_count     | average_deposit_amount  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------  |
| 5                         | $508.86                 | 

### 3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
```sql
WITH monthly_transaction_cte AS(
  SELECT customer_id,
  MONTH(txn_date) AS mth,
  SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS deposit_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type='purchase' THEN 1 ELSE  0 END) AS purchase_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN  txn_type='withdrawal' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) as withdrawal_count
  FROM customer_transactions
  GROUP BY customer_id,mth
)

SELECT mth, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count 
FROM monthly_transaction_cte
WHERE deposit_count > 1
AND (purchase_count = 1 OR withdrawal_count = 1 )
GROUP BY mth
ORDER BY mth;
```
#### Result set:
| mth                | customer_count |
| ------------------ | -------------  |
| 1                  | 115            | 
| 2                  | 108            | 
| 3                  | 113            | 
| 4                  | 50             | 

### 4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?

```sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
        MONTH(txn_date) AS mth,
        SUM(CASE 
                  WHEN txn_type = "deposit" THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) AS net_transaction_amount
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY customer_id, MONTH(txn_date)
ORDER BY customer_id
)

SELECT customer_id,
        mth,
        net_transaction_amount,
        SUM(net_transaction_amount) over(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY mth ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS closing_balance
FROM cte;
```
#### Result set:

The first ten rows of resulted table

### 5. What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?

```sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
        MONTH(txn_date) AS mth,
        SUM(CASE 
                  WHEN txn_type = "deposit" THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) AS net_transaction_amount
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY customer_id, mth
),
cte1 AS(
SELECT customer_id,
        mth,
        net_transaction_amount,
        SUM(net_transaction_amount) over(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY mth ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS closing_balance
FROM cte
),
cte2 AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
          mth,
          closing_balance,
          LAG(closing_balance) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY mth) AS previous_mth_closing_balance,
          100 * (closing_balance - LAG (closing_balance)OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY mth))/NULLIF(LAG(closing_balance)OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY mth),0) AS pct_increase
  FROM cte1
)

SELECT CAST(100.0*COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)FROM customer_transactions) AS FLOAT) as pct_customer 
FROM cte2
where pct_increase > 5;
```
#### Result set:

| pct_customer      |
| ----------------- | 
| 75.8              |
