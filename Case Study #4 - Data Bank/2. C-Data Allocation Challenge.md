## C. Data Allocation Challenge

## Case Study Questions
To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

- Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
- Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
- Option 3: data is updated real-time
  
For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

- running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction
- customer balance at the end of each month
- minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer
Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?

***
### 1. running customer balance column that includes impact of each transaction

Steps:

- Calculate the running balance for each customer based on the order of their transaction.
- Adjust the 'txn_amount' to be negative for withdrawal and purchase transactions to reflect a negative balance.

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
        txn_date,
        txn_type,
        txn_amount,
        SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN txn_amount 
                WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN -txn_amount
                WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN -txn_amount
            ELSE 0 
            END ) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
FROM customer_transactions;
```

### Output: 

*Kindly note that this is not the entire output. The entire output is long and would take up space.*

### 2. customer balance at the end of each month

- Calculate the closing balance for each customer for each month
- Adjust the 'txn_amount' to be negative for withdrawal and purchase transactions to reflect a negative balance

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
        MONTH(txn_date) AS month,
        MONTHNAME(txn_date) AS month_name,
        SUM (CASE WHEN txn_type ='deposit' THEN txn_amount 
                WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN -txn_amount
                WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN -txn_amount
            ELSE 0 
            END ) AS closing_balance
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY customer_id, month,month_name
ORDER BY  customer_id;
```

### Output: 

*Kindly note that this is not the entire output. The entire output is long and would take up space.*

### 3. minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

- Use a CTE to find the running balance of each customer based on the order of transaction
- Then calculate the minimum, maximum, and average balance for each customer.

```sql
WITH cte AS(
    SELECT customer_id,
            txn_date,
            txn_type,
            txn_amount,
            SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN txn_amount 
                    WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN -txn_amount
                    WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN -txn_amount
                ELSE 0 
                END ) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
    FROM customer_transactions
)

SELECT customer_id,
        ROUND(AVG(running_balance),2) AS average_running_balance,
        ROUND(MIN(running_balance),2) AS minimum_running_balance,
        ROUND(MAX(running_balance),2) AS maximum_running_balance
FROM cte
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
### Output: 

*Kindly note that this is not the entire output. The entire output is long and would take up space.*

Now for the three options, we will use each of the above calculated data elements to calculate how much data would have been required for each data allocation option on a monthly basis

### 3. minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

- Use a CTE to find the running balance of each customer based on the order of transaction
- Then calculate the minimum, maximum, and average balance for each customer.
