## C. Data Allocation Challenge

## Case Study Questions
To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

- Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
- Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
- Option 3: data is updated real-time
  
For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

- running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction
- customer balance at the end of each month
- minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer
Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?

***
### 1. running customer balance column that includes impact of each transaction

Steps:

- Calculate the running balance for each customer based on the order of their transaction.
- Adjust the 'txn_amount' to be negative for withdrawal and purchase transactions to reflect a negative balance.

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
        txn_date,
        txn_type,
        txn_amount,
        SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN txn_amount 
                WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN -txn_amount
                WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN -txn_amount
            ELSE 0 
            END ) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
FROM customer_transactions;
```

### Output: 

*Kindly note that this is not the entire output. The entire output is long and would take up space.*

### 2. customer balance at the end of each month

- Calculate the closing balance for each customer for each month
- Adjust the 'txn_amount' to be negative for withdrawal and purchase transactions to reflect a negative balance

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
        MONTH(txn_date) AS month,
        MONTHNAME(txn_date) AS month_name,
        SUM (CASE WHEN txn_type ='deposit' THEN txn_amount 
                WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN -txn_amount
                WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN -txn_amount
            ELSE 0 
            END ) AS closing_balance
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY customer_id, month,month_name
ORDER BY  customer_id;
```

### Output:

### 3. minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

- Use a CTE to find the running balance of each customer based on the order of transaction
- Then calculate the minimum, maximum, and average balance for each customer.

```sql
WITH cte AS(
    SELECT customer_id,
            txn_date,
            txn_type,
            txn_amount,
            SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN txn_amount 
                    WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN -txn_amount
                    WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN -txn_amount
                ELSE 0 
                END ) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
    FROM customer_transactions
)

SELECT customer_id,
        ROUND(AVG(running_balance),2) AS average_running_balance,
        ROUND(MIN(running_balance),2) AS minimum_running_balance,
        ROUND(MAX(running_balance),2) AS maximum_running_balance
FROM cte
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
### Output: 

*Kindly note that this is not the entire output. The entire output is long and would take up space.*

Now for the three options, we will use each of the above calculated data elements to calculate how much data would have been required for each data allocation option on a monthly basis

### Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month

- Use a CTE to calculate the net transaction amount for each customer for each transaction and for each customer
- Use a second CTE to calculate the running customer balance of each customer, this time using the ```ROWS BETWEEN
THE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW``` clause to define the range of the rows that the SUM function should consider for each. In this case it includes all the rows from the start of the partition up to and including the current row.
- Use a third CTE to calculate the month end balance for each customer
- Use the final query to calculate the data required per month by summing up the monthly ending balances for
each customer

```sql
WITH transaction_amt_cte AS
(
	SELECT customer_id,
	       txn_date,
	       MONTH(txn_date) AS txn_month,
	       txn_type,
	       CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount 
		    ELSE -txn_amount 
	       END AS net_transaction_amt
	FROM customer_transactions
),

running_customer_balance_cte AS
(
	SELECT customer_id,
	       txn_date,
	       txn_month,
	       net_transaction_amt,
	       SUM(net_transaction_amt) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, txn_month ORDER BY txn_date
	       ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_customer_balance
	FROM transaction_amt_cte
),

customer_end_month_balance_cte AS
(
	SELECT customer_id,
	       txn_month,
	       MAX(running_customer_balance) AS month_end_balance
	FROM running_customer_balance_cte
	GROUP BY customer_id, txn_month
)

SELECT txn_month,
       SUM(month_end_balance) AS data_required_per_month
FROM customer_end_month_balance_cte
GROUP BY txn_month
```

### Output:

### Observation:

1. More monthly data allocation is needed for January (368010) followed by Feburary (147006) and March (131283) while April (53434) requires the least amount of data allocation. Data allocated for each customer is directly related to their financial acitivity with Data Bank.
2. The positive data allocation means there's more savings in customer's account. Hence, customer with higher balance requires more data than those with lower balance.
3. With that being said, customers tend to have higher balance in the beginning month of the year specifically January and February compared to March and April. Therefore, more data is allocated to accomodate the higher balance in customer's account.
4. By optimizing data allocation and reduce unnecessary data allocation for each month based on customer's balance in previous month can help reduce Data Bank's operating cost of the server.

***

### Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days

- Use transaction_amt_cte CTE to calculate the net transaction amount for each customer in each month.
- Use running_customer_balance_cte CTE to calculate the running balance for each customer in each momth, 
based on the net transaction amount
- Use avg_running_customer_balance CTE to calculate the average running customer balance for ecah customer
across all months.
- In the final query, join the running_customer_balance and avg_running_customer_balancetables on the customer_id
column, group the data by month, and calculate the rounded sum of the average running customer balance as
data_required_per_month.

```sql
WITH transaction_amt_cte AS
(
	SELECT customer_id,
               MONTH(txn_date) AS txn_month,
	       SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
		        ELSE -txn_amount
		    END) AS net_transaction_amt
	FROM customer_transactions
	GROUP BY customer_id, MONTH(txn_date)
),

running_customer_balance_cte AS
(
	SELECT customer_id,
	       txn_month,
	       net_transaction_amt,
	       SUM(net_transaction_amt) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_month) AS running_customer_balance
	FROM transaction_amt_cte
), 

avg_running_customer_balance AS
(
	SELECT customer_id,
	       AVG(running_customer_balance) AS avg_running_customer_balance
	FROM running_customer_balance_cte
	GROUP BY customer_id
)

SELECT txn_month,
       ROUND(SUM(avg_running_customer_balance), 0) AS data_required_per_month
FROM running_customer_balance_cte r
JOIN avg_running_customer_balance a
ON r.customer_id = a.customer_id
GROUP BY txn_month
ORDER BY data_required_per_month;
```

### Output:

### Observation:

1. The average running customer balance is negative for all four months which could mean that more withdrawals than deposits by the customers on average
2. However, these negative running balances could be detrimental to bank's overall financial health especially for February and March which shows higher negative numbers. Hence, I suggests that bank collect more data for these two months to better understand customer behaviour during those months and potentiall identify any trends or anomalies behind these high negatives balance of bank's customers

***

### Option 3: data is updated real-time

- Use transaction_amt_cte CTE to calculate the net transaction amount for each customer for each month.
- Use running_customer_cte CTE to calculate the running balance for each customer by summing up the net transaction amounts over time(months).
- Use the final query to calculate the estimated data required per month for option 3, assuming that each byte of data requires one unit of storage.

```sql
WITH transaction_amt_cte AS
(
	SELECT customer_id,
	       txn_date,
	       MONTH(txn_date) AS txn_month,
	       txn_type,
	       txn_amount,
	       (CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) AS net_transaction_amt
	FROM customer_transactions
),

running_customer_balance_cte AS
(
	SELECT customer_id,
	       txn_month,
	       SUM(net_transaction_amt) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_month) AS running_customer_balance
	FROM transaction_amt_cte
)

SELECT txn_month,
       SUM(running_customer_balance) AS data_required_per_month
FROM running_customer_balance_cte
GROUP BY txn_month
ORDER BY data_required_per_month;
```
### Output:

### Observation:

1. The data required for the month of March is significantly higher than for the other months which shows that there were more transactions happening in March than in the other months.
2. The data required for January is positive compared to other months, indicating that there might be some customers who have a higher balance at the beginning of the year.
