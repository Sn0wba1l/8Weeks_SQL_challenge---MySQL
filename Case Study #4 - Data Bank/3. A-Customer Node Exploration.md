## A. Customer Nodes Exploration

## Case Study Questions
1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
2. What is the number of nodes per region?
3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?
   ***

### 1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) AS unique_node
FROM customer_nodes;
```
#### Result set:
| unique_node | 
| ----------- | 
| 5           | 

### 2. What is the number of nodes per region?
```sql
SELECT region_name,region_id,COUNT(node_id) AS unique_node
FROM regions
JOIN customer_nodes USING (region_id)
GROUP BY region_id,region_name
ORDER BY region_id;
```
#### Result set:
| region_name | region_id | unique_node   |
| ----------- | --------  | ------------- |
| Australia   | 1         | 770           |
| America     | 2         | 735           |
| Africa      | 3         | 714           |
| Asia        | 4         | 665           |
| Europe      | 5         | 616           |

### 3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
```sql
SELECT region_name,region_id,COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM regions
JOIN customer_nodes USING (region_id)
GROUP BY region_id,region_name
ORDER BY region_id;
```
#### Result set:
| region_name | region_id | customer_count |
| ----------- | --------  | -------------  |
| Australia   | 1         | 110            |
| America     | 2         | 105            |
| Africa      | 3         | 102            |
| Asia        | 4         | 95             |
| Europe      | 5         | 88             |

### 4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
```sql
SELECT round(avg(datediff(end_date, start_date)), 2) AS avg_days
FROM customer_nodes
WHERE end_date!='9999-12-31';
```
#### Result set:

| avg_day | 
| ------- | 
| 14.63   | 

It takes an average of at least 14 days for customers to be allocated to a different node

### 5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

#### 95th Percentile

```sql
WITH reallocation_days_cte AS(
  SELECT *, (datediff(end_date,start_date)) AS reallocation_days
  FROM customer_nodes 
  INNER JOIN regions USING (region_id)
  WHERE end_date!='9999-12-31'),

percentile_cte AS (
  SELECT *, percent_rank() over(PARTITION BY region_id ORDER BY reallocation_days) * 100 AS percent
  FROM reallocation_days_cte
),

dense_percentile_cte AS (
    SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() over(PARTITION BY region_id ORDER BY reallocation_days ASC ) AS r
    FROM percentile_cte
    WHERE percent>95
)

SELECT region_id, region_name, reallocation_days
FROM dense_percentile_cte
WHERE r=1
GROUP BY region_id,region_name,reallocation_days;

```

#### Result set:

#### 80th Percentile

```sql
WITH reallocation_days_cte AS(
  SELECT *, (datediff(end_date,start_date)) AS reallocation_days
  FROM customer_nodes 
  INNER JOIN regions USING (region_id)
  WHERE end_date!='9999-12-31'),

percentile_cte AS (
  SELECT *, percent_rank() over(PARTITION BY region_id ORDER BY reallocation_days) * 100 AS percent
  FROM reallocation_days_cte
),

dense_percentile_cte AS (
    SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() over(PARTITION BY region_id ORDER BY reallocation_days ASC ) AS r
    FROM percentile_cte
    WHERE percent>80
)

SELECT region_id, region_name, reallocation_days
FROM dense_percentile_cte
WHERE r=1
GROUP BY region_id,region_name,reallocation_days;
```

#### Result set:

#### Median Percentile

```sql
WITH reallocation_days_cte AS(
  SELECT *, (datediff(end_date,start_date)) AS reallocation_days
  FROM customer_nodes 
  INNER JOIN regions USING (region_id)
  WHERE end_date!='9999-12-31'),

percentile_cte AS (
  SELECT *, percent_rank() over(PARTITION BY region_id ORDER BY reallocation_days) * 100 AS percent
  FROM reallocation_days_cte
),

dense_percentile_cte AS (
    SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() over(PARTITION BY region_id ORDER BY reallocation_days ASC ) AS r
    FROM percentile_cte
    WHERE percent>50
)

SELECT region_id, region_name, reallocation_days
FROM dense_percentile_cte
WHERE r=1
GROUP BY region_id,region_name,reallocation_days;
```

#### Result set:
