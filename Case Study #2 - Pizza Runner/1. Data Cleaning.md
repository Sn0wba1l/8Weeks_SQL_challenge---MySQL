# Data Cleaning

## customer_orders table
- The exclusions and extras columns in customer_orders table will need to be cleaned up before using them in the queries  
- All the blank spaces and null values in exclusions and extras columns will be standardised to NULL

```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_orders_temp;
CREATE TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT  order_id,
        customer_id,
        pizza_id,
        CASE 
            WHEN exclusions = '' then NULL
            WHEN exclusions = 'null' then NULL
            ELSE exclusions
        END AS exclusions,
        CASE 
            WHEN extras = '' then NULL
            WHEN extras = 'null' then NULL
            ELSE extras
        END AS extras,
        order_time
    FROM customer_orders;
```
## Result:

BEFORE data cleaning, (customer_orders)

## runner_orders table
- In the pickup_time column, "null" will be changed to actual NULL value 
- In the distance column, there are data cell with unit "km" and "null". Hence, all "km" will be removed and "null" changed to NULL value
- In the duration column, there are data cell with unit "minutes", "mins" "minute" and "null". Hence, all 'minutes', 'mins' 'minute' will be removed and "null" changed to NULL value
- In the cancellation column, "null" and blank will be changed to actual NULL value 

```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_orders_temp;
CREATE TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
    order_id,
    runner_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
        ELSE pickup_time
    END AS pickup_time,
    CASE
        WHEN runner_orders.distance LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
        ELSE CAST(regexp_replace(distance,'[a-z]+','')AS FLOAT)
    END AS distance,
    CASE 
        WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
        ELSE CAST (regexp_replace(duration, '[a-z]+','')AS FLOAT)
    END AS duration,
    CASE
        WHEN cancellation LIKE '' THEN NULL
        WHEN cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
        ELSE cancellation
    END AS cancellation
FROM runner_orders;

# Converting comma separated string (string data listed horizontally in a single row ) into multiple rows (data listed vertically in multiple rows)

- pizza_recipe table consists of comma separated string data particularly toppings column
- Hence, JSON functions [ json_array() ] are utilised to convert comma separated string into multiple rows

```SQL
CREATE TABLE pizza_recipe_vertical(    
SELECT pizza_id, (j.topping) AS topping_id
FROM pizza_recipe t
JOIN json_table(trim(replace(json_array(t.toppings), ',', '","')), '$[*]' columns (topping varchar(50) PATH '$')) j 
);
```
## Result:

BEFORE converting, (pizza_recipe)
