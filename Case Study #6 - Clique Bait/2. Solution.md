### 1. How many users are there?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS user_count FROM users;
```

#### Result set:
| user_count |
| ---------- | 
| 500        |

###  2. How many cookies does each user have on average?
```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT user_id, COUNT(DISTINCT cookie_id) AS cookie_id_count
FROM users
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(cookie_id_count),0) AS avg_cookie_count
FROM cte;
```

#### Result set:
| avg_cookie__count |
| ----------------- |
| 4                 |

###  3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_time) AS month,
COUNT (DISTINCT visit_id) AS unique_visit_count
FROM events
GROUP BY month;
```
#### Result set:
| month       | unique_visit_count  |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| 1           | 876                 |

###  5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(100*COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) FROM events), ' %') AS percentage_visit
FROM events
JOIN event_identifier
USING(event_type)
WHERE event_name = 'purchase';
```
#### Result set:
| percentage_visit  |
| ----------------- |

###  6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?
```sql
WITH cte1 AS(
SELECT visit_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN event_name!='Purchase' and page_id=12 then 1 else 0 END) AS checkout,
SUM(CASE WHEN event_name='Purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
FROM events 
JOIN event_identifier
ON events.event_type=event_identifier.event_type
GROUP BY visit_id
