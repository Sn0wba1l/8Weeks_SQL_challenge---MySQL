## Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

- How many times was each product viewed?-
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
- How many times was each product purchased?


#### Steps

Identify that the output table consists of product name `Product_name`, product category `product_category`, views for each product `views`, number of carts add for each product `cart_adds`, number of times the product was added to a cart but not purchased `abandoned` and the number of times the product was purchased `purchases`.

1. Page views and cart adds column are obtained through `Sum` function and `Case` function in first cte `cte1`
2. The second CTE `cte2`focuses on filtering visit IDs for purchase event
3. Merge both `cte1` and `cte2` and filter visit ID with purchase event that is not NULL
4. Finaly, the user is said to have abandon from purchasing when the user added the product into his/her cart but did not proceed to purchase page. Vice versa, the user is said to have made a purchase when the user has added the product into the cart and proceed to purchase page.   

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT 
    visit_id,
    product_id,
    page_name AS Product_name,
    product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add
FROM events 
JOIN page_hierachy USING (page_id)
WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY visit_id, product_id, Product_name, product_category
),

cte2 AS (
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 3
),

combined_cte AS (
SELECT 
visit_id,
product_id,
Product_name,
product_category,
page_view,
cart_add,
CASE WHEN cte2.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
FROM cte1
LEFT JOIN cte2 USING (visit_id)
)

SELECT 
product_name,
product_category,
SUM(page_view) AS views,
SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds,
SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
FROM combined_cte
GROUP BY product_id,product_name, product_category
ORDER BY product_id;
```

#### Result set:

***
Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.
```SQL
WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT 
    visit_id,
    product_id,
    page_name AS Product_name,
    product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add
FROM events 
JOIN page_hierachy USING (page_id)
WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY visit_id, product_id, Product_name, product_category
),

cte2 AS (
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 3
),

combined_cte AS (
SELECT 
visit_id,
product_id,
Product_name,
product_category,
page_view,
cart_add,
CASE WHEN cte2.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
FROM cte1
LEFT JOIN cte2 USING (visit_id)
),

final_cte AS(
SELECT 
product_name,
product_category,
SUM(page_view) AS views,
SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds,
SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
FROM combined_cte
GROUP BY product_name,product_category)

SELECT * FROM final_cte;
```
#### Result set:

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?


|                   | product_name    | 
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Most views        | Oyster          | 
| Cart adds         | Lobster         |
| Purchases         | Lobster         |


2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?

|                   | product_name    | 
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Abandoned         | Russian Caviar  |

3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?

```SQL
SELECT product_name,
product_category,
ROUND(100*purchases/views,2) AS purchase_per_view_percentage
FROM final_cte
ORDER BY purchase_per_view_percentage DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

#### Result set:

4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?
5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(ROUND(100*AVG(cart_adds/views),2),' %') AS avg_conversion_rate_from_view_to_cart_add,
CONCAT(ROUND(100*AVG(purchases/cart_adds),2), ' %') AS avg_conversion_rate_from_cart_add_to_purchase
FROM final_cte;
```

#### Result set:
| avg_conversion_rate_from_view_to_cart_add | avg_conversion_rate_from_cart_add_to_purchase | 
|    :----------:                           |              :----------:                     |
|   60.95 %                                 |   75.93 %                                     |

## Campaigns Analysis

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
- `user_id`
- `visit_id`
- `visit_start_time`: the earliest event_time for each visit
- `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
- `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
- `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
- `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)

**Solution**

```sql
SELECT 
user_id,visit_id,
MIN(event_time) AS visit_start_time, 
SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds, 
SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,
campaign_name,
SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impression,
SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS click,
GROUP_CONCAT(CASE WHEN product_id IS NOT NULL AND event_type = 2 THEN p.page_name ELSE NULL END,', ' ORDER BY sequence_number) AS cart_products
FROM users
JOIN events USING(cookie_id)
LEFT JOIN campaign_identifier AS c  
    ON event_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
LEFT JOIN page_hierachy AS p USING (page_id)
GROUP BY user_id, visit_id, campaign_name;
```
#### Result set:

The table is too long. Hence, the table result set was split into two screenshotted results
