## Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

- How many times was each product viewed?-
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
- How many times was each product purchased?


#### Steps

Identify that the output table consists of product name `Product_name`, product category `product_category`, views for each product `views`, number of carts add for each product `cart_adds`, number of times the product was added to a cart but not purchased `abandoned` and the number of times the product was purchased `purchases`.

1. Page views and cart adds column are obtained through `Sum` function and `Case` function in first cte `cte1`
2. The second CTE `cte2`focuses on filtering visit IDs for purchase event
3. Merge both `cte1` and `cte2` and filter visit ID with purchase event that is not NULL
4. Finaly, the user is said to have abandon from purchasing when the user added the product into his/her cart but did not proceed to purchase page. Vice versa, the user is said to have made a purchase when the user has added the product into the cart and proceed to purchase page.   

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT 
    visit_id,
    product_id,
    page_name AS Product_name,
    product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add
FROM events 
JOIN page_hierachy USING (page_id)
WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY visit_id, product_id, Product_name, product_category
),

cte2 AS (
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 3
),

combined_cte AS (
SELECT 
visit_id,
product_id,
Product_name,
product_category,
page_view,
cart_add,
CASE WHEN cte2.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
FROM cte1
LEFT JOIN cte2 USING (visit_id)
)

SELECT 
product_name,
product_category,
SUM(page_view) AS views,
SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds,
SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
FROM combined_cte
GROUP BY product_id,product_name, product_category
ORDER BY product_id;
```

#### Result set:

***
Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.
```SQL
WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT 
    visit_id,
    product_id,
    page_name AS Product_name,
    product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add
FROM events 
JOIN page_hierachy USING (page_id)
WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY visit_id, product_id, Product_name, product_category
),

cte2 AS (
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 3
),

combined_cte AS (
SELECT 
visit_id,
product_id,
Product_name,
product_category,
page_view,
cart_add,
CASE WHEN cte2.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
FROM cte1
LEFT JOIN cte2 USING (visit_id)
)

SELECT 
product_category,
SUM(page_view) AS views,
SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds,
SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
FROM combined_cte
GROUP BY product_category;
```

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?


|                   | product_name    | 
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Most views        | Oyster          | 
| Cart adds         | Lobster         |
| Purchases         | Lobster         |


2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?

|                   | product_name    | 
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Abandoned         | Russian Caviar  |

3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?


7. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?
8. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?
